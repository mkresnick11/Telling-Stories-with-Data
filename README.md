# About Me

Hi! My name is Melanie Resnick and I'm a first year Heinz student in the Emtertainment Industry Management program. At the moment, I'm most interested in film and TV development, but that may change as I learn more about the entertainment industry.  

# What I Hope to Learn

I want to learn how to present data in a compelling and engaging way.
