# About Me

Hi! My name is Melanie Resnick and I'm a first year Heinz student in the Entertainment Industry Management program. I'm a native New Yorker, but have also lived in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Taipei and Hong Kong. Since graduating with a BA in History from Macalester College, I have worked in law, tech and publishing. At the moment, I'm most interested in film and TV development, but that may change as I learn more about the entertainment industry.  

# What I Hope to Learn

I want to learn how to visually communicate my findings from large amounts of data in a succient and clear way. In addition to clarity and accessibility, I want to learn how to make data visualizations that are compelling, engaging and persuasive. The kind of data visualizations that provoke further thought and lead a reader to take action.
